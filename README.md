## Use Okteto Variables with Docker Compose

Configuration is a core concept of every application, we understand how important it is for developers and teams to parametrize their project deployments and Okteto manifests. At Okteto we built different ways for you and your teams to manage and share config values using Okteto Variables.

[Okteto Variables](https://www.okteto.com/docs/1.34/core/okteto-variables/) can be used during build time or run time.

This repository contains example of how to use Okteto Variables to parametrize your docker compose applications.
